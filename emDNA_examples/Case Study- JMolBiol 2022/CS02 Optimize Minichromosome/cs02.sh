# Step 1: Run the linear ramping function
# --- Author suggestion: Double-check the contents of the INPUTFILE such that all commands required are correct
emDNA_probind INPUTFILE

# --- clean up data files into consistent names
cp emDNA_pb_confs.txt ${FILENAME}_confs.txt
cp emDNA_pb_final.txt ${FILENAME}.txt
cp emDNA_pb_stats.txt ${FILENAME}_stats.txt



# Step 2: Parse the ramping product from a reference frame list to a step-parameter file with sequence information
# --- Prepare the sequence information needed for Step 2

### OPTIONAL COMMANDS ---

# Option 1: Run free-collection on the emDNA_probind product to see how the linear piece compares with the bound nucleosomal pathway
#emDNA \
# --x3DNA-bp-step-params-input=${FILENAME}.par \
# --DNA-seqdep-model=Olson1998 \
# --frozen-steps=1:141 \
# --free-collection \
# --output-name=${FILENAME}_seqdep_free

# Option 2: Optimized the emDNA_probind product with the homopolymeric IdealDNA elastic model to get a detailed log file of this optimized product
# --- this will be a quick run as emDNA_probind used IdealDNA to optimized

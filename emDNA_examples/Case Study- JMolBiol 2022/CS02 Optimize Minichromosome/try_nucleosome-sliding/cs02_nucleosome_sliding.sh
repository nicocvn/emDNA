# This is an optional method that expands on Case Study 2 whose data is mentioned in the Case Study section of the Journal of Molecular Biology article below.
# In order to run this script, you will need the emDNA_probind product in its original base pair list file format.
# The end result of this script will be to produce 336 unique minicircles where the N336 sequence (see: Figure 2A, JMB article) moves along the DNA pathway, simulating protein sliding along the fragment.
# To run this code: $ ./cs02_nucleosome_sliding.sh
#
# -!-Author note: Based on the build of the user's machine, running this script may take over an hour. Please plan accordingly.

# 1. Make a new directory that will store all of the optimized data
mkdir optimization_data

# 2. Prepare the variables for the code and upload the sequence string

for ((i=1; i<=${#SEQUENCE}; i++));

 # Since 336 minicircles will be made, this line is used to ensure the same filename lengths
 printf -v SLIDEID "%03d" ${i}
 
 # Make sure you are running the correct ID number
 echo ${SLIDEID}
 
 # This is needed to "slide" the sequence by moving 'i' number of characters from the 3` end to the 5` end

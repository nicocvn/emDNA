This folder contains files surrounding the optimization of a 336-bp minicircle, including:
- The initial condition file: "N336.par"
- A bash script that can be run to execute all emDNA commands for this case study: "cs01.sh"
- "_results" directory containing the optimization log file and optimized step-parameter file from each optimization
- "_results-troubleshooting" directory containing the optimization log file and optimized step-parameter file from each optimization using the --free-collection flag

* It is the suggestion of the author to run troubleshooting first to ensure the build quality of emDNA.

The contents of this folder are discussed in "emDNA â€“ A Tool for Modeling Protein-decorated DNA Loops and Minicircles at the Base-pair Step Level" found in the 2022 Computational Resources Special Issue of the Journal of Molecular Biology (doi pending).

Please refer to the Case Studies portion of the above article for details regarding this case study.

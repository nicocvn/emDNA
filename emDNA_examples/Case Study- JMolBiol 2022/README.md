These three directories contain initial files, bash scripts, and optimized data files for the two case studies and the supplemental protocol found in the JMolBiol article.

"CS00"- refers to the Supplemental Protocol S1 where users can generate the 336-bp minicircle with the specific sequence (See paper Figure 2A). This requires Python3.X.

"CS01"- refers to the first case study, which relates to Figure 2 in the JMolBiol text.

"CS02"- refers to the second case study, which relates to Figure 3 in the JMolBiol text. This also contains a directory that lets users try the discussed "nucleosome sliding" protocol.

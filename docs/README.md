emDNA is a C++ software for minimizing the energy of DNA or DNA+proteins complexes.
It can handle various geometrical constraints (e.g. fixed end-to-end distance and/or rotation) and can be used to simulate opened or closed DNA fragments. The project provides a set of command-line tools to perform minimization operations and analyze optimized structures, as well as to assist in *sculpting* DNA+proteins complexes that can then be optimized.

The modeling and numerical methods are described in the following publications:

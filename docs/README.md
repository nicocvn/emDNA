emDNA is a C++ software for minimizing the energy of DNA or DNA+proteins complexes.
It can handle various geometrical constraints (e.g. fixed end-to-end distance and/or rotation) and can be used to simulate opened or closed DNA fragments. The project provides a set of command-line tools to perform minimization operations and analyze optimized structures, as well as to assist in *sculpting* DNA+proteins complexes that can then be optimized.

The modeling and numerical methods are described in the following publications:

- [The synergy between protein positioning and DNA elasticity: energy minimization of protein-decorated DNA minicircles](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c11612) (preprint publicly available on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7638))

emDNA is a C++ software for minimizing the energy of DNA or DNA+proteins complexes.
It can handle various geometrical constraints (fixed end-to-end distance and/or rotation) and can be used to simulate opened or closed DNA fragments. The project provides a set of command-line tools to perform minimization operations and analyze optimized structures (e.g. computing the topological numbers link, write and twist on circular configurations), as well as to assist in affixing structures 

The modeling and numerical methods are described in the following publications:

- [The synergy between protein positioning and DNA elasticity: energy minimization of protein-decorated DNA minicircles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7638) (publicly available on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org))

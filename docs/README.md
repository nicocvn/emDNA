emDNA is a C++ software for minimizing the energy of DNA or DNA+proteins complexes.
It can handle various geometrical constraints (e.g. fixed end-to-end distance and/or rotation) and can be used to simulate opened or closed DNA fragments. The project provides a set of command-line tools to perform minimization operations and analyze optimized structures, as well as to assist in *sculpting* DNA+proteins complexes that can then be optimized.

The modeling and numerical methods are described in the following publications:

- [The synergy between protein positioning and DNA elasticity: energy minimization of protein-decorated DNA minicircles](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c11612) (preprint publicly available on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7638))

## Special Issue: Computational Resources- 2022, Journal of Molecular Biology
In 2021, a manuscript was submitted to the Journal of Molecular Biology for the 2022 Special Issue on Computational Resources. In it included case studies for users. Users can be supplemental instructions, scripts, and optimized data [here](https://github.com/nicocvn/emDNA/tree/master/emDNA_examples/Case%20Study-%20JMolBiol%202022).
